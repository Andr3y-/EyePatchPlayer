vk-ios-sdk
==========

Library for working with VK API, authorization through VK app, using VK functions. Supported iOS from 6.0
Prepare for Using VK SDK
----------

To use VK SDK primarily you need to create a new VK application [here](https://vk.com/editapp?act=create) by choosing the Standalone application type. Choose a title and confirm the action via SMS and you will be redirected to the application settings page. 
You will require your Application ID (referenced as API_ID in the documentation). Fill in the App Bundle for iOS field. 

Setup URL-schema of Your Application
----------

To use authorization via VK App you need to setup a url-schema of your application. 

<b>Xcode 5 and above:</b>
Open your application settings then select the Info tab. In the URL Types section click the plus sign. Enter vk+APP_ID (e.g. **vk1234567**) to the Identifier and URL Schemes fields.

<b>Xcode 4:</b>
Open your Info.plist then add a new row URL Types. Set the URL identifier to vk+APP_ID


Configuring application for iOS 9
----------
iOS 9 changes the way of applications security and way of using unsecured connections. Basically, you don't have to change anything in transport security settings. But, if you're planing to use VK API with "nohttps" scope, you have to change security settings that way (in your Info.plist file):
```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
    <dict>
        <key>vk.com</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
            <false/>
            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
            <true/>
            <key>NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
            <true/>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

We're don't recommend you to use "nohttps" scope.

Also, for iOS 9 you have to enumerate app schemas which you app using (and checking for canOpenURL:) to have ability to open that apps. For VK SDK you should change your Info.plist in that way:
```
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>vkauthorize</string>
</array>
```

Adding VK iOS SDK to your iOS application
==========

Installation with CocoaPods
----------

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like VK SDK in your projects. See the "[Getting Started](http://cocoapods.org/)" guide for more information.

Podfile

    platform :ios, '6.0'
    pod "VK-ios-sdk"
    
Then import the main header.

    #import <VKSdk.h>

Installation with source code
----------

Add `VKSdk.framework` and `VKSdkResources.bundle` files into your project. In the Application settings open **Build phases**, then the **Link Binary with Libraries** section, add `VKSdk.framework` there. Add `VKSdkResources.bundle` into **Copy bundle resources** section. Import the main header:

    #import <VKSdk.h>

Using SDK
==========
Pre-requirements
----------
**Please read this section carefully if you don't want your app to be rejected!**

If your application is using VK SDK to provide the basic application functions, your app may be rejected by default (reason 10.6, see this issue #64), because the SDK is trying to authorize user through the Mobile Safari.
If you making such application, implement `-(BOOL)vkSdkIsBasicAuthorization {return YES;}` delegate method for tell SDK authorize with UIWebView first.

SDK Initialization
----------
1) Put this code to the application delegate method `application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:`
```
-(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation
{
    [VKSdk processOpenURL:url fromApplication:sourceApplication];
    return YES;
}
```
2) Initialize SDK with your APP_ID for any delegate.
```
    [VKSdk initializeWithDelegate:delegate andAppId:YOUR_APP_ID];
    if ([VKSdk wakeUpSession])
    {
        //Start working
    }
``` 
See full description of `VKSdkDelegate` protocol here: http://vkcom.github.io/vk-ios-sdk/Protocols/VKSdkDelegate.html

User Authorization
----------

There are several methods for authorization: 

    [VKSdk authorize:scope];
    [VKSdk authorize:scope revokeAccess:YES];
    [VKSdk authorize:scope revokeAccess:YES forceOAuth:YES];

Generally, `[VKSdk authorize:scope revokeAccess:YES]` is enough for your needs. 

When succeeded, the following method of delegate will be called:

    -(void) vkSdkReceivedNewToken:(VKAccessToken*) newToken;

In case of error (e.g., user canceled authorization):

    -(void) vkSdkUserDeniedAccess:(VKError*) authorizationError;

To get the User ID after authorization use method of `VKAccessToken` class

    [[VKSdk getAccessToken] userId] //Return NSString - authorized user id

API Requests
==========

Requests Syntax
----------
Below we have listed the examples for several request types. 
1) Plain request.

    VKRequest * audioReq = [[VKApi users] get];

2) Request with parameters.

    VKRequest * audioReq = [[VKApi audio] get:@{VK_API_OWNER_ID : @"896232"}];

3) Http (not https) request (only if scope `VK_PER_NOHTTPS` has been passed)

    VKRequest * audioReq = [[VKApi audio] get:@{VK_API_OWNER_ID : @"896232"}]; 
    audioReq.secure = NO;

4) Request with predetermined maximum number of attempts.

    VKRequest * postReq = [[VKApi wall] post:@{VK_API_MESSAGE : @"Test"}]; 
    postReq.attempts = 10; 
    //or infinite 
    //postReq.attempts = 0;

It will take 10 attempts until succeeds or an API error occurs. 

5) Request that calls a method of VK API (keep in mind scope value).

    VKRequest * getWall = [VKRequest requestWithMethod:@"wall.get" andParameters:@{VK_API_OWNER_ID : @"-1"} andHttpMethod:@"GET"];

6) Request for uploading photos on user wall.

    VKRequest * request = [VKApi uploadWallPhotoRequest:[UIImage imageNamed:@"my_photo"] parameters:[VKImageParameters pngImage] userId:0 groupId:0 ];

Requests Sending
----------

    [audioReq executeWithResultBlock:^(VKResponse * response) { 
            NSLog(@"Json result: %@", response.json); 
        } errorBlock:^(NSError * error) { 
        if (error.code != VK_API_ERROR) { 
            [error.vkError.request repeat]; 
        } else { 
            NSLog(@"VK error: %@", error); 
        } 
    }];

Error Handling
----------
Every request can return `NSError` with domain equal to `VKSdkErrorDomain`. SDK can return networking error or internal SDK error (e.g. request was canceled). Category `NSError+VKError` provides vkError property that describes error event. Compare error code with the global constant `VK_API_ERROR`. If they equal that means you process vkError property as API error. Otherwise you should handle an http error. 

Some errors (e.g., captcha error, validation error) can be proccessed by the SDK. Appropriate delegate methods will be called for this purpose. 
Below is an example of captcha error processing:

    -(void) vkSdkNeedCaptchaEnter:(VKError*) captchaError 
    { 
        VKCaptchaViewController * vc = [VKCaptchaViewController captchaControllerWithError:captchaError]; 
        [vc presentIn:self]; 
    }

Batch Processing Requests
----------
SDK gives a feature to execute several unrelated requests at the one call. 

1) Prepare requests
```
VKRequest * request1 = [[VKApi audio] get]; 
request1.completeBlock = ^(VKResponse*) { ... }; 

VKRequest * request2 = [[VKApi users] get:@{VK_USER_IDS : @[@(1), @(6492), @(1708231)]}]; 
request2.completeBlock = ^(VKResponse*) { ... };
```
2) Combine created requests into one.

    VKBatchRequest * batch = [[VKBatchRequest alloc] initWithRequests:request1, request2, nil];

3) Load the obtained request.

    [batch executeWithResultBlock:^(NSArray *responses) { 
            NSLog(@"Responses: %@", responses); 
        } errorBlock:^(NSError *error) { 
            NSLog(@"Error: %@", error); 
    }];
    
4) The result of each method returns to a corresponding completeBlock. The responses array contains responses of the requests in order they have been passed.

Working with Share dialog
==========
Share dialog allows you to create a user friendly dialog for sharing text and photos from your application directly to VK. See the Share dialog usage example:
```
VKShareDialogController * shareDialog = [VKShareDialogController new]; //1
shareDialog.text         = @"This post created using #vksdk #ios"; //2
shareDialog.vkImages     = @[@"-10889156_348122347",@"7840938_319411365",@"-60479154_333497085"]; //3
shareDialog.shareLink    = [[VKShareLink alloc] initWithTitle:@"Super puper link, but nobody knows" link:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://vk.com/dev/ios_sdk"]]; //4
[shareDialog setCompletionHandler:^(VKShareDialogControllerResult result) {
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
}]; //5
[self presentViewController:shareDialog animated:YES completion:nil]; //6
```
1) create an instance of the dialog controller as usual.

2) attach some text information to a dialog. Notice that users can change this information.

3) attach images uploaded to VK earlier. If you want user to upload a new image, use the `uploadImages` property.

4) attach link at your pages

5) set the dialog completion handler

6) present the dialog viewcontroller in your view controller

Working with share activity
==========

VK SDK provides a special class for working with `UIActivityViewController` - `VKActivity`. See example below for understand how it works:

```
NSArray *items = @[[UIImage imageNamed:@"apple"], @"Check out information about VK SDK" , [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://vk.com/dev/ios_sdk"]]; //1
UIActivityViewController *activityViewController = [[UIActivityViewController alloc]
                                                    initWithActivityItems:items
                                                    applicationActivities:@[[VKActivity new]]]; //2
[activityViewController setValue:@"VK SDK" forKey:@"subject"]; //3
[activityViewController setCompletionHandler:nil]; //4
if (VK_SYSTEM_VERSION_GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO(@"8.0")) {
    UIPopoverPresentationController *popover = activityViewController.popoverPresentationController;
    popover.sourceView = self.view;
    popover.sourceRect = [tableView rectForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
} //5
[self presentViewController:activityViewController animated:YES completion:nil]; //6
```

Lets see steps of the example:

1) Prepare your share information - `UIImage`, `NSString` and `NSURL`. That kind of information may be shared throught VK.

2) Prepare `UIActivityViewController` with new application `VKActivity`.

3) Set additional properties for `activityViewController`.

4) Set completion handler for `activityViewController`

5) Check if you're running above iOS 8. If user working with iPad, you must present the activity controller in popover, otherwise you'll get system error.

6) Present the activity controller as usual.
